# Python-Lectures

## Introduction

Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming. 

Python, similar to other languages like matlab or R, is interpreted hence runs slowly compared to C++, Fortran or Java. However writing programs in Python is very quick. Python has a very large collection of libraries for everything from scientific computing to web services. It caters for object oriented and functional programming with module system that allows large and complex applications to be developed in Python. 

These lectures are using jupyter notebooks which mix Python code with documentation. The python notebooks can be started with binder.
